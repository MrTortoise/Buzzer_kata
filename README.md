you have been asked to implement a module for megacorp because you have the skills they need!


There is a folder that you are not supposed to have access to.
This is because you are supposed to be implementing a module that meets a contract.

they have given you the boiler plate. 

Like with all code you get given and things you get asked to do you may notice things that don't add up.

The only files you can change are index.ts and dave.ts
of course you are welcome to create tests
